# Date: October 15, 2023
# Analyst: Erik Woodring (Illustrative)
# Rating: Overweight
# Price Target: $210.00

## Investment Thesis:

We reiterate our Overweight rating on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and maintain our $210 price target. Apple's ecosystem strength, driven by its highly loyal customer base and expanding Services segment, continues to provide a durable competitive advantage. While near-term macroeconomic headwinds may impact product replacement cycles, we believe Apple's innovation pipeline, particularly in wearables and potential new product categories (e.g., Vision Pro's long-term impact), positions the company for sustained long-term growth. The Services division, with its high margins and recurring revenue streams, offers a significant offset to product cyclicality and is a key driver of our positive outlook.

## Key Points:

*   **Services Momentum Continues:** We project Services revenue to grow at a ~10-12% CAGR over the next three years, driven by increasing penetration of paid subscriptions within Apple's vast installed base (now exceeding 2 billion active devices). Key growth drivers include App Store, advertising, AppleCare, and cloud services.
*   **iPhone Resilience:** Despite a mature smartphone market, iPhone continues to command premium pricing and strong customer loyalty. We anticipate modest unit growth but continued ASP (Average Selling Price) strength, supported by a favorable mix towards Pro models. The upcoming iPhone 15 cycle is expected to drive a typical upgrade cycle.
*   **Wearables and New Categories:** Apple Watch remains the dominant smartwatch, and AirPods lead the true wireless headphone market. The introduction of Vision Pro, while not expected to be a material revenue contributor in the near term, underscores Apple's commitment to innovation and could open up significant new market opportunities in spatial computing over the long term.
*   **Margin Stability:** Gross margins are expected to remain robust, supported by the increasing contribution from the high-margin Services segment and disciplined cost management. Product gross margins may see some pressure from component costs but are generally well-managed.
*   **Capital Returns:** Apple's strong free cash flow generation supports its significant capital return program, including dividends and share repurchases, which should continue to provide shareholder value.

## Q3 FY23 Review & Outlook:

Apple's Q3 results were slightly ahead of expectations, demonstrating resilience in a challenging environment. Services revenue was a standout, reaching an all-time high. iPhone sales, while down slightly year-over-year, showed strength in emerging markets. Mac and iPad sales were weaker, impacted by tough prior-year comparisons and softer consumer demand.

For FY24, we model total revenue growth of approximately 5-7%, driven primarily by Services and a modest recovery in iPhone sales. We anticipate continued R&D investment as Apple explores new technologies and product categories.

## Valuation:

Our $210 price target is based on a SOTP (Sum-Of-The-Parts) valuation, assigning a 28x P/E multiple to our FY24 Services EPS estimate and a 20x P/E multiple to our FY24 Products EPS estimate. This reflects the higher growth and margin profile of the Services business. Key risks to our target include a more severe macroeconomic downturn, increased regulatory scrutiny, and intensified competition.
